# Warbler - A Twitter Clone with a spin.

## Description
Warbler is a Twitter clone built using Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL.

## Demo
[https://warbler-demo-8888.herokuapp.com/](https://warbler-demo-8888.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the app

To run the app, first run the `seed.py` file directly to create the database tables:

```
$ python3 seed.py
```

You only need to do this once, unless you change your model definitions.

Then run the app itself:

```
$ flask run -p 5001
```

Visit [http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001/) in your browser to see the results.
